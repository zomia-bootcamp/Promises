/*

1. Create a function called `useSTO()`. 
- Your `useSTO()` function should have no parameters. 
- Inside the function body, it should print a string to the console. This can be any string you want.

Check your work to move on to the next step.

2. Invoke the setTimeout() function. Remember, setTimeout() has two parameters. 
Invoke setTimeout() with your `useSTO()` function as the first argument and a number between 0 and 3000 as the second argument.

3. STOP! Before you run your code, read it carefully and try to think, what will the output look like?

<your answer>

4. After completing your answer, run your code, did you get it right?

console.log("This is the first line of code in app.js.");
// Keep the line above as the first line of code!!



// Write your code here:

const useSTO =() =>{
    console.log("I am using  ")
}

setTimeout(useSTO,1000)

    
// Keep the line below as the last line of code:
console.log("This is the last line of code in app.js.");
